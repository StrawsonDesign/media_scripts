# media scripts
bash scripts for batch media processing.
This is purely for personal use

ffmpeg_helper.sh recursively finds video files starting in the directory from which it is run. It asks the user a series of questions to determine which presets to use. The output files are placed in a subdirectory "./completed" unless an output directory is specified by a command line argument.
#Usage
`media_script.sh [input directory] [output directory]`
